    <h1>Temple Extension</h1>

    <div class="bs-callout">
        <p>
            We are delighted to let you know that the Hillingdon Council has now approved<a href="docs/Planning Granted May 2014.pdf"  target="_blank"> our plans</a> for a substantial extension at the rear and side of the temple to build a new kitchen, toilets, store room will figure in the first phase of development. The second stage will involve construction of the Shrine in front of the temple and it will be on the lines of the image presented.    
        </p>
        <p>                            
            This development will give storage facility, prepare Maha Prasad for Mataji, for priests and devotees. It goes without saying that future generations stand to benefit from the presence of an improvised sacred building. Of course, good work of this magnitude can be done only with substantial investment.
        <p>
            Background and Current Position:  Adhya Shakti Mataji Temple with its magnificent Goddess Amba seated majestically inside, was inaugurated on 15th November 2007. First Phase total cost including materials is approximately £260,000 and we are short of £160,000. It is in this connection that I beseech your support to realise our dream for our beloved Goddess Amba Ma or Mataji. The starting date for the first phase is 4th Sept, 2014. The second phase of the shrine will cost around £250,000.
        </p>
        <p>
